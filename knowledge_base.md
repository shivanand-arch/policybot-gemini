**Effective Date:** April 1, 2025

**Applies To:** All Account Directors within the growth organisation of the company

## Growth Incentive Plan Structure

### Plan Components

The Growth Incentive Plan consists of two key elements:

1. **Quarterly Growth Incentive Plan (80% of annual variable CTC)**
   - Distributed equally across four quarters with 20% allocated to each quarter
   - Performance-linked and assessed based on predefined KPIs aligned with quarterly goals

2. **Yearly Growth Incentive Plan (20% of annual variable CTC)**
   - Evaluated at the end of the financial year based on individual annual performance

### Financial Year and Quarter Definitions

- **Year:** April to March
- **Q1:** April to June
- **Q2:** July to September
- **Q3:** October to December
- **Q4:** January to March

## Performance Metrics and Weightage

The Individual Performance Linked Variable (IPLV) for Accounts Directors is structured around two primary metrics:

| Performance Metric | Weightage |
|---|---|
| Order Bookings | 55% |
| Gross Profit Growth | 45% |

### Order Booking Slabs

| Booking Attainment | Payout % |
|---|---|
| Less Than 40% | NIL |
| Less Than 50% | 30% |
| Less Than 60% | 40% |
| Less Than 70% | 60% |
| Less Than 80% | 80% |
| Less Than or Equal 90% | 100% |
| Greater Than 90% | 100% + 120% of Incremental above 90% - max cap at 200% |

### Gross Profit Growth Slabs

The payout follows linear progression between slabs with maximum payout capped at 200%:

| GP Growth/NRGP Attainment | Payout % |
|---|---|
| 0% | NIL |
| 10% | 5% |

| 130% | 140% |
| 150% | 160% |
| 180% | 200% |
| 200% | 200% |

## Order Booking and Target Achievement Guidelines

### Definition of Order Booking (OB)

Order booking is recognized and accounted for only in the case of:
- ECC (Enterprise Communications Cloud)
- AI (Conversational AI)
- Committed Voice deals

These are engagements where revenue commitment is clear and contractually agreed upon.

### Quarterly Assessment and Independence Principle

- OB targets and achievements are assessed on a quarterly basis
- Over-achievement or under-achievement in a given quarter does not influence or carry over to the next quarter
- Each quarter's performance is evaluated independently to maintain clarity and fairness
- Starting point for each quarter remains fixed, ensuring consistent goal-setting throughout the year
- For annual assessment, the sum total of quarterly targets and achievements is considered
- This independence principle ensures that performance in earlier quarters does not artificially impact later quarter assessments

### Net New Order Booking Attribution

All orders booked for new customers, new SKUs, or upsells in existing SKUs for existing customers within the first 4 quarters from first go-live for that SKU are considered net new booking.

**Booking Categories and Attribution:**

1. **License Subscription (Enterprise CC and Conversational AI)**
   - Attribution: Commit MRR as per PO
   - Assumption: Billing continues for at least 12 months after 100% commit MRR achievement
   - Churn before 12 months: Triggers reversal/bad debt

2. **Paid POC**
   - Attribution: Pro-rata basis (e.g., 1-month POC = 1/12th of MRR; 3-month POC = 1/4th of MRR)
   - Applicable to: ECC and AI only

3. **Short Rental**
   - Attribution: Pro-rata basis (same calculation as Paid POC)
   - Applicable to: ECC and AI only

4. **Capex License & Onetime Services**
   - Attribution: 1/36th of actual PO value

### Cross Sell and Growth Scenarios

**Cross Sell New:** Orders for customers under Scaleup 1 to Retention 2
- Attribution: In line with applicable category (1-4 above)
- Applicable: ECC, AI, committed voice, and voice streaming deals only

**Cross Sell:** Orders for customers under Retention 3
- Attribution: In line with applicable category (1-4 above)
- Applicable: ECC, AI, committed voice, and voice streaming deals only

**Growth of 10X in Existing SKU:** MRR growth above 10X in existing run rate for organic growth (Retention 3 customers)
- Treated as cross-sell and considered under net new booking if criteria are met
- Criteria:
  - Last billed revenue should be 100K or less
  - 10x growth must be calculated from highest revenue achieved in the last 6 months
- Applicable to: ECC, AI, committed voice, and voice streaming deals only

### Committed Deals Definition

A committed deal refers to any arrangement where the customer has a contractual obligation to pay a minimum committed amount—be it for usage or licenses—regardless of actual usage/consumption. Minimum commitment timeframe: 12 months of billing.

**Included in Committed Deals:**
- Voice and Voice Streaming Deals: New bookings backed by contracts mentioning committed billing amounts
- No exit clauses allowing customer to terminate or reduce commitment during committed period
- Payment obligation is independent of actual usage/volume

**Not Included:**
- Number Rental, Fixed Rentals, Lead Assist
- Billing fixed but not bound by contracts
- Billing based purely on actual consumption/usage without contractual commitment clause
- Committed deals for renewals

### Normalized OT (One-Time)

Converts one-time booking amount into monthly recurring revenue (MRR) equivalent. Calculation: Total one-time booking value divided by 36 (reflecting standard 3-year period).

### SKU-Based Order Booking Attribution

Different SKUs are eligible for different order booking categories. This framework ensures accurate attribution and incentive calculation based on SKU and deal type combinations.

| SKU | New Sales | Cross Sell | Cross Sell New | Upsell | Normalized OT |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| ECC | YES | YES | YES | YES | YES |
| AI - Traditional | YES | YES | YES | YES | YES |
| AI - Voicebot | YES | YES | YES | YES | YES |
| AI - CQA | YES | YES | YES | YES | YES |
| Voice | YES (if CC) | YES (if CC) | YES (if CC) | YES (if CC) | YES |
| Voice Streaming | YES (if CC) | YES (if CC) | YES (if CC) | YES (if CC) | YES |
| SMS | NO | NO | NO | NO | YES |
| Truecaller | NO | NO | NO | NO | YES |
| WhatsApp | NO | NO | NO | NO | YES |

**Legend:** CC = Committed Contract; YES = Eligible for quota attainment; NO = Not eligible for quota attainment; Normalized OT = One-Time services normalized to MRR equivalent

## Bad Debt and Order Reversal Adjustments

### Bad Debt

**Definition:** Any invoiced amount written off post service delivery and formally approved by Finance Controller or CFO.

**Penalty:** 2x the original order booking value will be levied for bad debt instances to ensure ownership and accountability.

### Order Reversal

**Definition:** Withdrawal or cancellation of booked order prior to full execution.

**Conditions Triggering Reversal:**
- Withdrawal initiated by customer due to technical or commercial reasons (confirmed by Business Unit Head)
- Cancellation approved by management based on valid technical or business grounds
- Orders remaining unexecuted (fully or partially) for more than 6 months from original booking date are deemed reversed by default
- Pro-rata reversal if customer churns before 12 months or does not ramp up fully in line with booking amounts

**Penalty:** 1.3x the order booking value applies to all reversed orders.

### Account Transition

Post-transition, all outcomes—both positive and negative—associated with accounts are attributed to the new owner. This includes revenue reversals, bad debts, and other financial impacts.

## Gross Profit Growth Incentive Framework

### Definition and Measurement of Growth

Gross Profit (GP) growth is measured as the incremental growth achieved from the base GP (defined at the beginning of the financial year) to the targeted GP for the year. This ensures alignment with the company's strategic growth objectives.

### Calculation Frequency

GP achievement and corresponding incentive calculations are conducted on a Year-to-Date (YTD) basis every quarter. This allows for continuous tracking of progress and timely disbursement of incentives.

### Payout Structure

**Payout Frequency:** Incentives based on GP are paid out quarterly based on performance against defined targets.

**Cumulative Calculation:** While payouts occur quarterly, GP performance is cumulatively tracked and reconciled every quarter. This ensures a running view of YTD performance and transparency on performance evolution.

**No Claw-Back:** There will be no claw-back on quarterly payouts. Once disbursed, the payout is considered final, irrespective of year-end achievements. This reinforces trust, stability, and predictability in incentive earnings.

## Due, Disbursement and Payout

### Quarterly Incentive

- **Due Date:** Incentive becomes due by mid-point of the following quarter, based on performance of preceding quarter
  - Example: Q1 FY26 incentive becomes due by August 2026
- **Calculation Communication:** Incentive figures shared within 10 calendar days of due date
- **Disbursal:** Takes place in the immediate payroll cycle following communication of incentive
- **Acceptance:** In absence of queries raised within 2 working days of sharing figures, incentive amount is considered accepted and processed accordingly

### Yearly Incentive

The yearly incentive is computed after completion of the financial year and disbursed along with Q4 quarterly incentive.

## Eligibility Criteria

### Active Employment Requirement

Incentive payouts (both quarterly and yearly) are made only if the employee is in active and continuous employment:
- Until the last working day of the respective quarter for quarterly incentives
- Until the last working day of the financial year for the yearly incentive

### Pro-Rata Incentive for Partial Period

Any pro-rata incentive for a partial quarter or year served is at the discretion of the functional/cluster head. In such cases, a cluster average incentive may be awarded, subject to adjustments deemed fit by the approving authority.

### Mid-Joiner IPLV Structure

For employees joining mid-year or mid-quarter, the IPLV is calculated on a pro-rata basis:

- **First Quarter of Service:** 25% of the quarterly IPLV amount
- **Subsequent Quarters:** 100% of the quarterly IPLV amount

This structure ensures equitable treatment while appropriately accounting for partial period service. Employees are not penalized for late joining but also do not receive full incentive for the quarter in which they join. For detailed mid-joiner provisions and specific calculation examples, refer to the IPLV Policy document.

## Maximum Limits on Incentive Payouts

### Quarterly Payout Cap and Carryforward Rules

- Quarterly incentive accrual is based on respective slabs and payable up to 100% of quarterly variable component
- Any incentive accrued beyond 100% is automatically carried forward and held in escrow for the annual true-up calculation
- Carried forward amounts are disbursed along with Q4 incentive at the end of the financial year
- **Critical Rule:** If employee exits the organization before March 31, any carried forward (excess) incentive lapses entirely and is not payable
- The 100% quarterly cap is strict and prevents excess quarterly payouts

### Annual Payout Cap

Total annual payout under IPLV scheme is capped at maximum of 200% of declared IPLV value for any eligible employee.

### Annual True-Up and Reconciliation

**Year-End Reconciliation:** A comprehensive true-up calculation is performed after the conclusion of the financial year (after March 31st). This final calculation assesses overall annual performance against full-year targets.

**No Clawback Principle:** Critical principle applies - there is NO clawback on quarterly payouts that were paid up to their 100% quarterly cap. If overall annual attainment is less than what has been already paid in quarterly installments, those quarterly payments remain final and are not reversed or reduced.

**Payout for Over-Attainment:** If annual true-up reveals overall attainment exceeding 100% of annual target, the additional earned amount (beyond the sum of all quarterly 100% cap payouts) is calculated and disbursed as a lump sum at the time of annual true-up. This ensures employees are not penalized for early strong performance.

## Collection Targets and Impact on Incentive

### Monthly Target Setting

Collection targets are defined and communicated at beginning of each month. Aggregate of monthly targets constitutes quarterly collection target for the respective cluster.

### Measurement Approach

Collections performance is tracked at cluster level and serves as a multiplier on incentive payouts, rather than being a direct component of incentive calculation.

### Collection Multiplier Structure

Collection targets serve as a multiplier on accrued incentives rather than a direct component of the calculation. The multiplier is applied after Order Bookings and Gross Profit Growth incentives are calculated.

| Collection Attainment | Payout % |
|---|---|
| Less Than 90% | 90% of accrued incentive |
| 90% to Less Than 95% | Payout at linear rate of collection achievement |
| Less Than or Equal 100% | 100% of accrued incentive |
| More Than 100% | Payout at linear rate of collection achievement - max cap at 105% |

**Examples:**
- If collection achievement is 85%, employee receives 90% of accrued OB and GP incentive
- If collection achievement is 92%, employee receives 92% of accrued incentive
- If collection achievement is 110%, employee receives 105% of accrued incentive (capped)

## General Terms and Conditions

### Eligibility

- Only full-time employees on payroll are eligible for incentive payouts
- Employees must be actively employed at time of payout to qualify for any incentive earned

### Performance Basis

- Incentives calculated based on actual performance against defined targets (e.g., Bookings, Gross Profit)
- Only validated and recognized business performance (as per CRM and finance data) is considered

### Payout Frequency

- Incentives processed quarterly and/or annually, as defined under specific plan
- Payouts subject to final approvals and clearance of data validations and audits

### Payout Capping

Maximum payout capped at 200% of eligible incentive, both for quarterly and annual payouts. Performance beyond capped limit does not accrue additional payouts.

### Adjustments and Reversals

- Any reversals, order cancellations, or revenue clawbacks lead to adjustment in subsequent incentive payouts
- Management reserves right to recover any incentive paid in error

### Contractual and Documentation Requirements

- All deals must be backed by valid contracts/POs/MSAs to be considered for incentive attribution
- Email confirmations or verbal commitments are not eligible unless specified as exceptions in writing

### Disqualification

- Falsification of data or misrepresentation of bookings/performance results in disqualification from incentive plan and may lead to disciplinary action
- Employees serving notice or under Performance Improvement Plan (PIP) may be disqualified at management's discretion

### Force Majeure

Company reserves right to alter, suspend, or cancel incentive payouts in case of unforeseen events or force majeure circumstances.

### Review and Governance

- All incentive-related disputes reviewed by RevOps/Finance/HR committee with final and binding decisions
- Any policy changes or amendments communicated in advance and take effect prospectively unless stated otherwise
- Under exceptional circumstances, HR team with appropriate internal approvals reserves right to make retrospective amendments if deemed necessary in larger interest of organization

### Taxation

All incentive payouts are subject to applicable taxes as per prevailing laws.

### Approval and Implementation

This policy is approved by management team and implemented with effect from April 1, 2025. All previous growth policies cease to exist and are replaced by this policy.

# Growth Incentive Policy - Customer Experience Managers

## Purpose
This policy defines and outlines the Growth Incentive Program, which rewards employees who contribute significantly to the company's growth and success.

## Applicability
This policy applies to all Customer Experience (CX) Managers within the growth organisation of the company. Specific eligibility criteria are defined in the relevant program details.

## Growth Incentive Plan Overview

The Growth Incentive Plan is designed to reward performance and business impact through a structured combination of quarterly and annual components consisting of two key elements:

### Quarterly Growth Incentive Plan
- Accounts for 80% of the annual variable portion of the CTC
- Distributed equally across four quarters (20% per quarter)
- Payout is performance-linked and assessed based on predefined KPIs aligned with quarterly goals

### Yearly Growth Incentive Plan
- Comprises the remaining 20% of the annual CTC variable
- Evaluated at the end of the financial year based on individual annual performance

### Financial Year Calendar
- Year: April to March
- Q1: April to June
- Q2: July to September
- Q3: October to December
- Q4: January to March

## Metrics and Weightage

The Individual Performance Linked Variable (IPLV) for CX Managers ties payouts to two primary metrics:

| Performance Metric | Weightage |
|-------------------|-----------|
| NRGP | 55% |
| Gross Profit Growth | 45% |

## Performance Slabs and Payout Structure

Payout follows linear progression between slabs, with maximum payout capped at 200%:

| GP Growth/NRGP Attainment | Payout % |
|--------------------------|----------|
| 0% | NIL |
| 10% | 5% |
| 20% | 10% |
| 30% | 20% |
| 40% | 30% |
| 50% | 40% |
| 60% | 50% |
| 70% | 70% |
| 80% | 80% |
| 90% | 90% |
| 95% | 100% |
| 130% | 140% |
| 150% | 160% |
| 180% | 200% |
| 200% | 200% |

## Eligibility and Mid-Joiner IPLV Structure

### Active Employment Requirement
- Incentive payouts are made only if the employee is in active and continuous employment:
  - Until the last working day of the respective quarter for quarterly incentives
  - Until the last working day of the financial year for the yearly incentive
- Pro-rata incentive for partial periods at functional/cluster head discretion

### Mid-Joiner IPLV Structure
For employees joining mid-year or mid-quarter, the IPLV is calculated on a pro-rata basis:

- **First Quarter of Service:** 25% of the quarterly IPLV amount
- **Subsequent Quarters:** 100% of the quarterly IPLV amount

This ensures equitable treatment while appropriately accounting for partial period service.

## NRGP Target Calculation Framework

### Quarterly NRGP
- Calculated by comparing the sum of Retention 3 in the current quarter against the sum of Retention 2 and Retention 3 from the preceding quarter
- The base (Retention 2 and 3 of Q4 from previous year) is normalized to exclude multi-period billings and credit notes
- This base remains constant across quarters for consistency
- Only incremental additions in Retention 2 for the current quarter are normalized and included

### Annual NRGP
- Base is the total subscription value (Scaleup 1 to Retention 3) from Q4 of the preceding financial year
- Compared against the Retention 3 value of Q4 of the current financial year to determine annual performance

## Gross Profit Growth Incentive Framework

### Definition & Measurement
- GP growth is measured as incremental growth achieved from the base GP (defined at the beginning of the financial year) to the targeted GP for the year
- Ensures alignment with strategic growth objectives

### Calculation Frequency
- GP achievement and corresponding incentive calculations are conducted on a Year-to-Date (YTD) basis every quarter
- Allows for continuous tracking and timely disbursement of incentives

### Payout Structure
- **Payout Frequency**: Incentives paid out quarterly based on performance against defined targets
- **Cumulative Calculation**: GP performance tracked cumulatively and reconciled every quarter for transparency
- **No Clawback**: No clawback on quarterly payouts; once disbursed, payout is final regardless of year-end achievements

## Due Dates, Disbursement and Payout Timeline

### Quarterly Incentive
- Becomes due by the mid-point of the following quarter (e.g., Q1 FY26 incentive due by August 2025)
- Incentive calculation and figures shared within 10 calendar days of the due date
- Disbursal takes place in the immediate payroll cycle following communication
- Incentive amount considered accepted and processed if no queries raised within 2 working days

### Yearly Incentive
- Computed after completion of the financial year
- Disbursed along with the Q4 quarterly incentive

## Eligibility Criteria

Incentive payouts (both quarterly and yearly) are made only if the employee is in active and continuous employment:
- Until the last working day of the respective quarter for quarterly incentives
- Until the last working day of the financial year for yearly incentive

Pro-rata incentive for partial quarter or year served is at the discretion of the functional/cluster head. In such cases, a cluster average incentive may be awarded, subject to adjustments deemed fit by the approving authority.

### Mid-Joiner Policy
Refer to the IPLV Policy document for mid-joiner incentive guidelines.

## Maximum Limits on Incentive Payouts

### Quarterly Payout Cap
- Quarterly incentive accrual is based on respective slabs and payable up to 100% of the quarterly variable component
- Any incentive accrued beyond 100% is carried forward and disbursed as part of annual true-up with Q4 incentive
- If employee exits before 31st March, any carried forward incentive lapses and is not payable

### Annual Payout Cap
- Total annual payout under IPLV is capped at maximum of 200% of the declared IPLV value

### Annual True-up and Reconciliation
- Comprehensive true-up calculation performed at end of financial year
- Assessment of overall annual performance against full-year target
- **No Clawback for Under-Attainment**: If overall annual attainment is less than what has been paid, no amount from quarterly installments (up to 100% quarterly cap) is subject to clawback
- **Payout for Over-Attainment**: If annual true-up reveals attainment exceeding 100% of annual target, additional earned amount (beyond sum of quarterly 100% payouts) is disbursed as lump sum

## Collection Targets and Impact on Incentive

### Monthly Target Setting
- Collection targets defined and communicated at beginning of each month
- Aggregate of monthly targets constitutes quarterly collection target for the cluster

### Measurement Approach
- Collections performance tracked at cluster level
- Serves as multiplier on incentive payouts, not direct component of incentive calculation

### Collection Multiplier Framework

| Collection Attainment | Payout % |
|----------------------|----------|
| Less Than 90% | 90% of accrued incentive |
| Less Than 95% | Linear rate of collection achievement |
| Less Than or equal to 100% | 100% of accrued incentive |
| More Than 100% | Linear rate at max cap of 105% |

## Bad Debt and Order Reversal Adjustments

### Bad Debt
- Defined as invoiced amount written off post service delivery and formally approved by Finance Controller or CFO
- Penalty: 2x the original order booking value

### Order Reversal

  - Orders unexecuted for more than 6 months from booking date deemed reversed by default
  - Pro-rata reversal if customer churns before 12 months or doesn't ramp up per booking amounts
- Penalty: 1.3x the order booking value

- Management reserves right to recover any incentive paid in error

### Contractual and Documentation Requirements
- All deals must be backed by valid contracts, POs, or MSAs for incentive attribution
- Email confirmations or verbal commitments not eligible unless specified as exceptions in writing

### Disqualification
- Falsification of data or misrepresentation results in disqualification and may lead to disciplinary action

## Order Booking and Target Achievement Guidelines

### Definition of Order Booking (OB)

Order booking shall be recognized and accounted for only in the case of ECC, AI, and committed Voice deals. These are defined as engagements where revenue commitment is clear and contractually agreed upon. Please refer to the prevailing Order Booking Policy for a detailed breakdown.

### Quarterly Assessment of OB Achievement

- OB targets and achievements will be assessed on a quarterly basis
- Any over-achievement or under-achievement in a given quarter will not influence or carry over to the next quarter
- Each quarter's performance will be evaluated independently to maintain clarity and fairness in measurement
- The starting point for each quarter remains fixed, ensuring consistent goal-setting and evaluation throughout the year

### Bad Debt and Order Reversal Adjustments

#### Bad Debt
- Defined as any invoiced amount written off post service delivery and formally approved by Finance Controller or CFO
- Penalty of 2x the original order booking value will be levied

#### Order Reversal
- Refers to withdrawal or cancellation of booked order prior to full execution
- Includes withdrawal initiated by customer due to technical or commercial reasons, with BU Head confirmation
- Cancellation approved by management based on valid technical or business grounds
- Orders remaining unexecuted for more than 6 months from booking date deemed reversed by default
- Pro-rata reversal if customer churns before 12 months or does not ramp up fully
- Penalty of 1.3x the order booking value shall apply

## Sales Pipeline Incentive Framework

### Funnel Creation Target

- To ensure a healthy sales pipeline, the funnel creation target has been set at 4X of the overall Order Booking target
- This target is based on the total Order Booking value, inclusive of all product lines
- To maintain balance and focus across revenue streams, Messaging funnel attribution will be capped at 20% of the total funnel creation target
- This ensures that no single line of business disproportionately influences funnel health

### Sales Accepted Lead (SAL) Criteria

- Only opportunities that meet the Sales Accepted Lead (SAL) criteria will be considered valid
- SAL value will be the baseline for funnel measurement
- SAL acceptance will serve as the qualification checkpoint
- Finalized funnel creation targets will be communicated separately by the RevOps team, in alignment with the CRO and respective Business Unit Heads

## Gross Profit Growth Incentive Framework

### Definition & Measurement of Growth

Gross Profit (GP) growth will be measured as the incremental growth achieved from the base GP (defined at the beginning of the financial year) to the targeted GP for the year. This ensures alignment with the company's strategic growth objectives.

### Calculation Frequency

The GP achievement and corresponding incentive calculations will be conducted on a Year-to-Date (YTD) basis every quarter. This allows for continuous tracking of progress and timely disbursement of incentives.

### Payout Structure

- **Payout Frequency**: Incentives based on Gross Profit (GP) will be paid out quarterly based on performance against the defined targets
- **Cumulative Calculation**: While payouts occur quarterly, the GP performance will be cumulatively tracked and reconciled every quarter. This ensures a running view of YTD performance and enables transparency on how performance evolves over time
- **No Claw-Back**: There will be no claw-back on quarterly payouts. Once disbursed, the payout is considered final, irrespective of year-end achievements. This approach reinforces trust, stability, and predictability in incentive earnings

## Due, Disbursement and Pay-out

### Quarterly Incentive

The quarterly incentive shall become due by the mid-point of the following quarter, based on performance of the preceding quarter (Example: Q1 FY26 incentive computed and due by August 2026):
- Incentive calculation and figures will be shared within 10 calendar days of the due date
- Disbursal shall take place in the immediate payroll cycle following the communication of the incentive
- In the absence of any queries raised within 2 working days of sharing the figures, the incentive amount shall be considered accepted and will be processed accordingly

### Yearly Incentive

The yearly incentive shall be computed after the completion of the financial year and will be disbursed along with the Q4 quarterly incentive.

## Eligibility Criteria

Incentive payouts (both quarterly and yearly) shall be made only if the employee is in active and continuous employment:
- Until the last working day of the respective quarter for quarterly incentives
- Until the last working day of the financial year for the yearly incentive

Any pro-rata incentive for a partial quarter or year served shall be at the discretion of the functional/cluster head. In such cases, a cluster average incentive may be awarded, subject to adjustments deemed fit by the approving authority.

## Quarterly Assessment Independence Principle

All performance metrics are assessed on a quarterly basis with complete independence between quarters:

- Over-achievement or under-achievement in one quarter does not influence or carry over to subsequent quarters
- Each quarter's performance is evaluated independently to maintain clarity and fairness
- Starting point for each quarter remains fixed, ensuring consistent goal-setting throughout the year
- This independence principle ensures that performance in earlier quarters does not artificially impact later quarter assessments
- For annual assessment, the sum total of all quarterly targets and achievements is considered

## Incentive Policy for Mid-Joiners

For employees joining mid-year or mid-quarter, the IPLV is calculated on a pro-rata basis:

- **First Quarter of Service:** 25% of the quarterly IPLV amount
- **Subsequent Quarters:** 100% of the quarterly IPLV amount

This ensures equitable treatment while appropriately accounting for partial period service.

## Maximum Limits on Incentive Payouts

### Quarterly Cap Carryforward Rules

Quarterly incentive accrual will be based on the respective slabs defined for each incentive category and shall be payable up to 100% of the quarterly variable component. Any incentive accrued beyond 100% is automatically carried forward and held in escrow for the annual true-up calculation. Carried forward amounts are disbursed along with the Q4 incentive payout at the end of the financial year. **Critical Rule:** In the event an employee exits the organization before 31st March, any carried forward (excess) incentive will lapse entirely and shall not be payable.

### Annual Payout Cap

The total annual payout under the IPLV scheme shall be capped at a maximum of 200% of the declared IPLV value for any eligible employee.

### Annual True-Up and Reconciliation

A comprehensive year-end reconciliation is performed after March 31st. Critical principle: There is NO clawback on quarterly payouts that were paid up to their 100% quarterly cap. If overall annual attainment is less than quarterly payouts already made, those quarterly payments remain final and are not reversed. Any additional over-attainment beyond the sum of quarterly 100% payouts is calculated and paid as a lump sum at year-end true-up.

### Annual True-up and Reconciliation (Applicable only for Bookings and GP)

- **Year-End Reconciliation**: A comprehensive true-up calculation will be performed at the conclusion of the financial year. This final calculation will assess overall annual performance against the full-year target
- **No Clawback for Under-Attainment**: In cases where the overall annual attainment is determined to be less than whatever has been already paid, no amount previously paid out in quarterly installments (up to their 100% quarterly cap) will be subject to clawback
- **Payout for Over-Attainment**: If the annual true-up calculation reveals an overall attainment exceeding 100% of the annual target, the additional earned amount (beyond the sum of the quarterly 100% payouts) will be disbursed as a lump sum at the time of the annual true-up

## General Terms and Conditions

### 1. Eligibility

Only full-time employees on the payroll are eligible for incentive payouts. Employees must be actively employed at the time of payout to qualify for any incentive earned.

### 2. Performance Basis

Incentives will be calculated based on actual performance against defined targets (e.g., Bookings, Gross Profit, etc.). Only validated and recognized business performance (as per CRM and finance data) will be considered.

### 3. Payout Frequency

Incentives will be processed quarterly and/or annually, as defined under the specific plan. Payouts are subject to final approvals and clearance of data validations and audits.

### 4. Payout Capping

## Order Booking and Target Achievement Guidelines

### Definition of Order Booking (OB)

Order booking shall be recognized and accounted for only in the case of ECC, AI, and committed Voice deals. These are defined as engagements where revenue commitment is clear and contractually agreed upon. Please refer to the Order Booking Policy for a detailed breakdown.

### Quarterly Assessment of OB Achievement

- OB targets and achievements will be assessed on a quarterly basis
- Any over-achievement or under-achievement in a given quarter will not influence or carry over to the next quarter
- Each quarter's performance will be evaluated independently to maintain clarity and fairness in measurement
- The starting point for each quarter remains fixed, ensuring consistent goal-setting and evaluation throughout the year
- For annual assessment of OB achievement, the sum total of quarterly targets and achievements shall be considered

### Net New Order Booking Attribution

All orders booked for new customers or new SKU or upsell in existing SKU for existing customers within the first 4 quarters from the first go live for that SKU shall be considered as net new booking.

### Order Booking Included

1. **License Subscription (Enterprise CC and Conversational AI)**: Order booking attribution shall be the commit MRR as per the PO with an assumption that the billing will continue for at least 12 months. Any churn happening before 12 months shall call for reversal/bad debt.

2. **Paid POC**: Attribution done on a pro-rata basis (e.g., 1-month = 1/12th of MRR). Applicable for ECC and AI only.

3. **Short Rental**: Attribution done on a pro-rata basis (e.g., 1-month = 1/12th of MRR). Applicable for ECC and AI only.

4. **Capex License & Onetime services**: Attribution is 1/36th of the actual PO value.

### Cross Sell and Growth Rules

- **Cross sell New**: Cross sell orders for customers under Scaleup 1 to Retention 2 considered as Cross sell new
- **Cross sell**: Cross sell orders for customers under Retention 3
- **Growth of 10X in existing SKU**: MRR growth above 10X in existing run rate for organic (Retention 3) treated as cross sell under Net New booking if last billed revenue is 100K or less and 10x growth is from highest revenue of last 6 months

### Committed Deal Definition

A committed deal refers to any arrangement where the customer has a contractual obligation to pay a minimum committed amount—be it for usage or licenses—regardless of actual usage/consumption. Minimum timeframe for commitment must be 12 months of billing.

### Bad Debt and Order Reversal Adjustments

#### Bad Debt
- Defined as any invoiced amount written off post service delivery and formally approved by Finance Controller or CFO
- Penalty of 2x the original order booking value levied

#### Order Reversal
- Refers to withdrawal or cancellation of booked order prior to full execution
- Includes customer withdrawal due to technical/commercial reasons with BU Head confirmation
- Management-approved cancellation based on technical/business grounds
- Orders unexecuted for more than 6 months from booking date deemed reversed by default
- Pro-rata reversal if customer churns before 12 months or doesn't ramp up fully
- Penalty of 1.3x the order booking value applied

#### Account Transition
Post-transition, all outcomes (positive and negative) associated with accounts attributed to new owner, including reversals and bad debts.

## Gross Profit Growth Incentive Framework

### Definition & Measurement of Growth

Gross Profit (GP) growth measured as incremental growth achieved from base GP (defined at beginning of financial year) to targeted GP for the year. Ensures alignment with company's strategic growth objectives.

### Calculation Frequency

GP achievement and corresponding incentive calculations conducted on a Year-to-Date (YTD) basis every quarter. Allows continuous tracking of progress and timely disbursement of incentives.

### Payout Structure

- **Payout Frequency**: Incentives based on Gross Profit paid out quarterly based on performance against defined targets
- **Cumulative Calculation**: GP performance cumulatively tracked and reconciled every quarter for running view of YTD performance
- **No Claw-Back**: There will be no claw-back on quarterly payouts. Once disbursed, the payout is considered final, irrespective of year-end achievements

## Due, Disbursement and Pay-out

### Quarterly Incentive

The quarterly incentive shall become due by the mid-point of the following quarter, based on performance of the preceding quarter (Example: Q1 FY26 incentive computed and due by August 2026):
- Incentive calculation and figures shared within 10 calendar days of due date
- Disbursal takes place in immediate payroll cycle following communication of incentive
- In absence of queries within 2 working days, incentive amount considered accepted and processed accordingly

### Yearly Incentive

The yearly incentive shall be computed after completion of financial year and disbursed along with Q4 quarterly incentive.

### Eligibility Criteria

Incentive payouts (both quarterly and yearly) made only if employee is in active and continuous employment:
- Until last working day of respective quarter for quarterly incentives
- Until last working day of financial year for yearly incentive
- Any pro-rata incentive for partial quarter or year served at discretion of functional/cluster head

### Incentive Policy for Mid-Joiners

Please refer to the IPLV policy document for mid-joiner guidelines.

## Quarterly Assessment Independence Principle

All performance metrics are assessed on a quarterly basis with complete independence between quarters:

- Over-achievement or under-achievement in one quarter does not influence or carry over to subsequent quarters
- Each quarter's performance is evaluated independently to maintain clarity and fairness
- Starting point for each quarter remains fixed, ensuring consistent goal-setting throughout the year
- This independence principle ensures that performance in earlier quarters does not artificially impact later quarter assessments
- For annual assessment, the sum total of all quarterly targets and achievements is considered

## Collection Targets and Impact on Incentive

### Monthly Target Setting

Collection targets defined and communicated at beginning of each month. Aggregate of monthly targets constitutes quarterly collection target for respective cluster.

### Measurement Approach

Collections performance tracked at cluster level and serves as a multiplier on incentive payouts, rather than direct component of incentive calculation.

### Multiplier Framework

| Collection Attainment | Payout % |
|----------------------|----------|
| Less Than 90%        | 90% of accrued incentive |
| Less Than 95%        | Payout at linear rate of collection achievement |
| Less Than or equal to 100% | 100% of accrued incentive |
| Greater Than 100%    | Payout at linear rate - max cap at 105% |

## Maximum Limits on Incentive Payouts

### Quarterly Cap Carryforward Rules

Quarterly incentive accrual based on respective slabs defined for each incentive category, payable up to 100% of quarterly variable component. Any incentive accrued beyond 100% is automatically carried forward and held in escrow for the annual true-up calculation. Carried forward amounts are disbursed with Q4 incentive payout. **Critical Rule:** If employee exits before 31st March, carried forward incentive lapses entirely and is not payable.

### Annual Payout Cap

Total annual payout under IPLV scheme capped at maximum of 200% of declared IPLV value for any eligible employee.

### Annual True-up and Reconciliation

- **Year-End Reconciliation**: A comprehensive true-up calculation is performed after the conclusion of the financial year (after March 31st). This final calculation assesses overall annual performance against full-year targets.
- **No Clawback Principle**: Critical principle applies - there is NO clawback on quarterly payouts that were paid up to their 100% quarterly cap. If overall annual attainment is less than quarterly payouts already made, those quarterly payments remain final and are not reversed or reduced.
- **Payout for Over-Attainment**: If annual true-up reveals overall attainment exceeding 100%, the additional earned amount (beyond the sum of all quarterly 100% cap payouts) is calculated and disbursed as a lump sum at annual true-up. This ensures employees are not penalized for early strong performance.

## General Terms and Conditions

### 1. Eligibility

Only full-time employees on the payroll are eligible for incentive payouts. Employees must be actively employed at time of payout to qualify for any incentive earned.

### 2. Performance Basis

Incentives calculated based on actual performance against defined targets. Only validated and recognized business performance (as per CRM and finance data) considered.

### 3. Payout Frequency

Incentives processed quarterly and/or annually as defined. Payouts subject to final approvals and clearance of data validations and audits.

### 4. Payout Capping

Maximum payout capped at 200% of eligible incentive, both quarterly and annual payouts. Performance beyond capped limit will not accrue additional payouts.

### 5. Adjustments and Reversals

Any reversals, order cancellations, or revenue clawbacks lead to adjustment in subsequent incentive payouts. Management reserves right to recover any incentive paid in error.

### 6. Contractual and Documentation Requirements

All deals must be backed by valid contracts/POs/MSAs to be considered for incentive attribution. Email confirmations or verbal commitments not eligible unless specified as exceptions in writing.

### 7. Disqualification

Falsification of data or misrepresentation of bookings/performance results in disqualification from incentive plan and may lead to disciplinary action. Employees serving notice or under Performance Improvement Plan (PIP) may be disqualified at management's discretion.

### 8. Force Majeure

Company reserves right to alter, suspend, or cancel incentive payouts in case of unforeseen events or force majeure circumstances.

### 9. Review and Governance

All incentive-related disputes reviewed by RevOps/Finance/HR committee and decisions final and binding. Any change or amendment in policy communicated in advance and takes effect prospectively unless stated otherwise. Under exceptional circumstances, HR team with appropriate approvals reserves right to make retrospective amendments if deemed necessary in larger interest of organization.

### 10. Taxation

## Gross Profit Growth Incentive Framework

### Definition and Measurement of Growth

Gross Profit (GP) growth is measured as the incremental growth achieved from the base GP (defined at the beginning of the financial year) to the targeted GP for the year. This ensures alignment with the company's strategic growth objectives.

### Calculation Frequency

GP achievement and corresponding incentive calculations are conducted on a Year-to-Date (YTD) basis every quarter. This allows for continuous tracking of progress and timely disbursement of incentives.

### Payout Structure

**Payout Frequency:** Incentives based on GP are paid out quarterly based on performance against defined targets.

**Cumulative Calculation:** While payouts occur quarterly, GP performance is cumulatively tracked and reconciled every quarter. This ensures a running view of YTD performance and transparency on performance evolution.

**No Claw-Back:** There will be no claw-back on quarterly payouts. Once disbursed, the payout is considered final, irrespective of year-end achievements. This reinforces trust, stability, and predictability in incentive earnings.

## Due, Disbursement and Payout

- **Due Date:** Incentive becomes due by mid-point of the following quarter, based on performance of preceding quarter
  - Example: Q1 FY26 incentive becomes due by August 2026
- **Calculation Communication:** Incentive figures shared within 10 calendar days of due date
- **Disbursal:** Takes place in the immediate payroll cycle following communication of incentive
- **Acceptance:** In absence of queries raised within 2 working days of sharing figures, incentive amount is considered accepted and processed accordingly

### Yearly Incentive

The yearly incentive is computed after completion of the financial year and disbursed along with Q4 quarterly incentive.

## Eligibility Criteria

### Pro-Rata Incentive for Partial Period

Any pro-rata incentive for a partial quarter or year served is at the discretion of the functional/cluster head. In such cases, a cluster average incentive may be awarded, subject to adjustments deemed fit by the approving authority.

## Quarterly Assessment Independence Principle

All performance metrics are assessed on a quarterly basis with complete independence between quarters:

- Over-achievement or under-achievement in one quarter does not influence or carry over to subsequent quarters
- Each quarter's performance is evaluated independently to maintain clarity and fairness
- Starting point for each quarter remains fixed, ensuring consistent goal-setting throughout the year
- This independence principle ensures that performance in earlier quarters does not artificially impact later quarter assessments
- For annual assessment, the sum total of all quarterly targets and achievements is considered

Total annual payout under IPLV scheme is capped at maximum of 200% of declared IPLV value for any eligible employee.

### Annual True-Up and Reconciliation

**Year-End Reconciliation:** A comprehensive true-up calculation is performed after the conclusion of the financial year (after March 31st). This final calculation assesses overall annual performance against full-year targets.

**No Clawback Principle:** Critical principle applies - there is NO clawback on quarterly payouts that were paid up to their 100% quarterly cap. If overall annual attainment is less than quarterly payouts already made, those quarterly payments remain final and are not reversed or reduced.

**Payout for Over-Attainment:** If annual true-up reveals overall attainment exceeding 100% of annual target, the additional earned amount (beyond the sum of all quarterly 100% cap payouts) is calculated and disbursed as a lump sum at the time of annual true-up. This ensures employees are not penalized for early strong performance.

## Collection Targets and Impact on Incentive

### Monthly Target Setting

Collection targets are defined and communicated at beginning of each month. Aggregate of monthly targets constitutes quarterly collection target for the respective cluster.

### Measurement Approach

Collections performance is tracked at cluster level and serves as a multiplier on incentive payouts, rather than being a direct component of incentive calculation.

### Collection Multiplier Structure

| Collection Attainment | Payout % |
|---|---|
| Less Than 90% | 90% of accrued incentive |
| Less Than 95% | Payout at linear rate of collection achievement |
| Less Than or Equal 100% | 100% of accrued incentive |
| More Than 100% | Payout at linear rate of collection achievement - max cap at 105% |

## General Terms and Conditions

### Eligibility

- Only full-time employees on payroll are eligible for incentive payouts
- Employees must be actively employed at time of payout to qualify for any incentive earned

### Performance Basis

- Incentives calculated based on actual performance against defined targets (e.g., Bookings, Gross Profit)
- Only validated and recognized business performance (as per CRM and finance data) is considered

- Incentives processed quarterly and/or annually, as defined under specific plan
- Payouts subject to final approvals and clearance of data validations and audits

### Payout Capping

Maximum payout capped at 200% of eligible incentive, both for quarterly and annual payouts. Performance beyond capped limit does not accrue additional payouts.

### Adjustments and Reversals

- Any reversals, order cancellations, or revenue clawbacks lead to adjustment in subsequent incentive payouts
- Management reserves right to recover any incentive paid in error

### Contractual and Documentation Requirements

- All deals must be backed by valid contracts/POs/MSAs to be considered for incentive attribution
- Email confirmations or verbal commitments are not eligible unless specified as exceptions in writing

### Disqualification

- Falsification of data or misrepresentation of bookings/performance results in disqualification from incentive plan and may lead to disciplinary action
- Employees serving notice or under Performance Improvement Plan (PIP) may be disqualified at management's discretion

### Force Majeure

Company reserves right to alter, suspend, or cancel incentive payouts in case of unforeseen events or force majeure circumstances.

### Review and Governance

- All incentive-related disputes reviewed by RevOps/Finance/HR committee with final and binding decisions
- Any policy changes or amendments communicated in advance and take effect prospectively unless stated otherwise
- Under exceptional circumstances, HR team with appropriate internal approvals reserves right to make retrospective amendments if deemed necessary in larger interest of organization

**Recipients:** All Employees

**Effective Date:** September 1, 2025

**Version:** 2.0 (Updated September 1, 2025)

## Document Scope and Confidentiality

This document is the sole property of Exotel and is intended for internal use only. It contains confidential information for authorized staff use only. Disclosure to third parties is prohibited. All on-roll and off-roll employees, vendors, and suppliers must follow this document as applicable. Non-compliance will result in disciplinary measures by Exotel.

## Purpose

Exotel believes that performance management and review is an important component of supporting employees in their work, ensuring accountability for work performed, and establishing an appropriate support framework suited to employee needs.

Exotel is committed to ensuring that all employees:
- Have the opportunity to build a successful career at Exotel
- Have a clear understanding of work they are expected to deliver
- Are clear about the organisation's expectations and requirements
- Are provided with adequate direction and support
- Perform their role to the best of their abilities
- Are accountable for quality and outcomes of their work

The PIP process is initiated for employees who need additional support with their performance. The PIP is intended to create an opportunity for employees to succeed and thrive in their roles and may be adapted based on individual progress and feedback.

## Scope

This policy applies to all full-time employees of Exotel Techcom Pvt. Ltd. and its subsidiaries, regardless of department or job level, who are experiencing performance challenges that impact their role or team. Effective September 1, 2025.

## Key Definitions

**Performance Improvement Plan (PIP):** A structured document outlining specific areas of underperformance, improvement goals, support mechanisms, and timelines.

**Performance Standards:** The expected level of job performance as defined in job descriptions, evaluations, and organizational policies.

**Underperformance:** Gaps in meeting defined expectations, including task completion, quality, timelines, and professional behavior.

## Addressing Performance Concerns

Exotel acknowledges that employees may occasionally face challenges hindering performance. The organization is committed to helping employees overcome difficulties through a fair and supportive process.

The PIP process includes two stages:
1. **Performance Counseling (Informal)**
2. **Performance Improvement Plan (Formal)**

These stages provide a framework for identifying and addressing concerns early, enabling sustainable performance improvements.

## Performance Counseling (Informal Stage)

Performance counseling is an informal, preparatory stage helping employees:
- Understand strengths and areas for development
- Receive constructive feedback on behavior and performance
- Set clear goals and action plans for improvement
- Discuss concerns in a supportive and empathetic environment

The manager initiates and facilitates counseling sessions. Common performance concerns include:
- Incomplete or inaccurate work
- Missed deadlines or poor project management
- Consistent deviation from role expectations
- Behavioral challenges affecting team dynamics or stakeholders
- Non-compliance with company policies

## Transition from Performance Counseling to Formal PIP

### Performance Counseling: Format & Timeline

| Stage | Details |
|---|---|
| **Trigger Event** | Manager identifies early signs of underperformance (quantitative/qualitative) |
| **Initial Discussion** | One-on-one meeting between manager and employee to discuss concerns constructively |
| **Support Offered** | Manager provides feedback, coaching, and/or recommends training or peer support |
| **Employee Expectations** | Employees expected to demonstrate measurable progress in identified areas |
| **Review Meeting** | End of counseling period: manager and employee meet to assess improvement and decide next steps |
| **Decision Point** | If satisfactory progress made, no further action required. If not, formal PIP may be initiated |

### Checklist for Transition to PIP

Before initiating a formal PIP, the following must be ensured:

1. At least 2 counseling sessions have been conducted
2. Specific, measurable concerns have been communicated clearly and documented between employee and manager
3. Support, guidance, and resources have been offered
4. Employees have had a fair opportunity and time to improve (minimum 2 weeks)
5. No significant or consistent improvement has been observed
6. HR has been informed and consulted before initiating the PIP

### Initiating a Formal PIP

A formal PIP may be initiated if an employee:
- Consistently fails to meet performance standards or agreed metrics
- Demonstrates behavior misaligned with company values
- Receives below-standard ratings in reviews
- Shows no improvement despite prior feedback and coaching
- Any other reason that the Manager deems fit

**Important:** Should an employee decline to participate in the Performance Improvement Plan (PIP), the company reserves the right to take appropriate action, which may include concluding the employment arrangement.

## Roles and Responsibilities

### Employee Responsibilities

- Actively contribute to ongoing improvement efforts, offering ideas and support to help drive success
- Seek feedback regularly and apply it thoughtfully to enhance performance and development
- Provide clear, consistent updates on progress and key milestones to keep others informed

### Manager Responsibilities

- Schedule weekly 30-minute check-ins to offer guidance, set expectations, and ensure steady progress
- Review employee's submitted updates in advance to make each meeting focused and productive
- Engage mentors or peers when appropriate, providing the employee with additional perspectives and support
- Maintain detailed records of each discussion in the PIP tracker to ensure transparency and accountability

### HR Responsibilities

- Conduct independent meetings with the manager and employee
- Ensure the process is fair, transparent, and aligned with company values
- Provide support and mediation as required

## Plan Duration and Review

### Plan Duration

The Performance Improvement Plan will be implemented over a defined period, typically ranging from 30 to 60 days, depending on the nature and severity of the performance concerns.

### Clear Expectations

At the outset, the manager will outline specific goals, performance benchmarks, and measurable outcomes expected during the PIP period. These will be documented and agreed upon by both manager and employee.

### Ongoing Monitoring

Weekly check-ins between manager and employee will be scheduled to:
- Review progress against set goals
- Provide feedback and guidance
- Make necessary course corrections
- Address any concerns or roadblocks

### Progress Documentation

The employee will be required to submit weekly status updates prior to each review meeting. The outcomes of each discussion will be recorded in the PIP tracker.

### Final Review

At the end of the PIP period, a comprehensive evaluation of the employee's performance will be conducted, involving:
- Assessment of improvement against defined objectives
- Consolidated feedback from the manager and other relevant stakeholders
- Final decision on the outcome of the PIP

### Communication of Outcome

The final decision will be formally communicated to:
- The employee
- The relevant Functional Head
- The Human Resources team

The outcome will also be acknowledged and signed off by the employee as a record of closure.

## Possible Outcomes

### 1. Successful Completion

Performance expectations are met, and the employee continues in the role without further intervention.

### 2. Reassignment or Role Adjustment

If suitable, the employee may be transitioned to a role better aligned with their skills and strengths.

### 3. Separation

If, despite the support and efforts provided during the PIP period, performance continues to fall short of expectations, the organization may consider concluding the employment relationship. Any such decision will be taken with due diligence and in alignment with Exotel's separation policy, ensuring the process is handled with respect, fairness, and professionalism.

## Leaves During PIP

Employees are expected to remain actively engaged and committed throughout the PIP period to ensure a fair and accurate evaluation of progress. However, Exotel recognizes that unforeseen circumstances may arise. In the event of a genuine medical or personal emergency, leave may be granted upon submission of valid documentation. In such cases, the PIP timeline may be thoughtfully paused and adjusted to accommodate the employee's situation, ensuring both compassion and fairness in the process.

## Support and Mentoring

Employees are encouraged to take an active role in their growth by seeking guidance from their manager or senior team members. At Exotel, we believe that mentorship, open dialogue, and consistent feedback are powerful tools in nurturing potential. This collaborative approach is designed to empower employees, foster confidence, and support them in achieving sustained success in their roles.

## Exceptions and Interpretation

Any exceptions to this policy must be approved by the Head of HR. Exotel reserves the right to revise, interpret, or withdraw this policy at any time.

## Types of Feedback

### Comprehensive Feedback

To provide a detailed view of consistent or recurring performance issues, behaviors, and skill gaps observed over time.

**Characteristics:**
- **Depth:** In-depth, multi-dimensional
- **Formality:** Formal, documented
- **Timing:** Scheduled (bimonthly)
- **Goals:** Broad performance view
- **Intent:** Long-term development

### Incidental Feedback

To highlight specific incidents or behaviors that need immediate attention or correction to prevent escalation.

**Characteristics:**
- **Depth:** Single-event based
- **Formality:** Informal or semi-formal
- **Timing:** Real-time, not exceeding 48 hours
- **Goals:** Narrow behavioral observation
- **Intent:** Immediate reinforcement and correction

## Feedback Guidelines

### 1. Differentiate the Purpose

- Use comprehensive feedback to address ongoing patterns and long-term development areas
- Use incidental feedback for immediate, situational concerns requiring quick correction

### 2. Be Timely and Specific

- Deliver incidental feedback as close to the observed behavior as possible
- Use comprehensive feedback during PIP check-ins to address recurring patterns, supported by examples and tied to overall performance expectations

### 3. Focus on Behavior, Not Personality

- Address the action or outcome, not the individual
- This maintains a constructive tone and reduces defensiveness

### 4. Link Feedback to Expectations

- Tie both types of feedback to clearly defined performance standards, goals, or company values to make expectations tangible

### 5. Document and Follow Up

- Record all feedback—incidental and comprehensive—in the PIP tracker to ensure accountability and continuity
- Revisit previously discussed points in future check-ins to assess progress and reinforce improvement
